            <p>We conducted user studies to compare different designs of the Obsidian language to see which is best for programmers. If you participated, thank you!</p>
            
<p>Obsidian detects bugs involving loss of <em>assets</em> and <em>improper invocation of transactions</em> in smart contracts. We recruited 20 programmers. We asked 10 of them to complete a programming task in Solidity and 10 to complete the same task in Obsidian. Of 9 programmers who thought they finished the task in Solidity, 7 inserted bugs that lost assets! None of the 8 who thought they completed the task in Obsidian lost any assets. You can read more about this study in our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3428200">OOPSLA paper</a>.</p>

<p>We also conducted formative studies so that we could base the design of Obsidian on data from users. We summarized these formative studies in an upcoming <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04719">TOCHI paper</a></p>.
