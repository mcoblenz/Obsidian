\subsection{Without Pointers}

story: overhead here but it's acceptable. optimizer does a lot.

\subsection{With Pointers}

story: lots of overhead; it's cheaper to turn off gc, because you're doing
more work collecting than you get repaid for

\subsection{Linked List}

story: once you have enough in storage, the rebates take over and are more
than the cost of collecting them. with a simple LL structure that's around
XXX. if you imagine a doubly linked list backing a priority / de / queue,
it'll be faster. that datastructure is known to be hard to implement in the
sort of associative mappings that are built into solidity, and its use
might arise very naturally from a smart contract that processes queries in
arrival order.
