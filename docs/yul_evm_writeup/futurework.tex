\subsection{Optimizations}

For each transaction, emit two transactions: one that operates entirely on
memory and one on storage. this means that before calling a transaction you
need to check once where its instance lives, but after that there are no
additional checks. by contrast, now, each transaction checks the location
of its instance before each interaction with either memory or storage. this
is always the same, so all but the first check is redundant.
