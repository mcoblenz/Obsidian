  ## todo / iev: jdk9 works, 15 doesn't. up to 12 seems to work.

## todo / iev: gradle that was getting run on the jdk15 shot above was 5.1.1 but current version
##  is 6.8.3. so that probably needs to get updated to work with modern java, but i'm not sure
##  where that's happening. the errors i was seeing were of the form of not finding libraries.
