node_js:
     - 15.11.0 ## cirremt as of 4 march 2021

# This may be necessary depending on the tests we eventually run. For example,
# the chaincode base server uses "java.util.Base64", which is only supported
# as of java version 8
jdk:
  - oraclejdk12
  ## todo / iev: jdk9 works; jdk15 doesn't. figure out how high you can go and why
  # - not.

## todo / iev: gradle that was getting run on the jdk15 shot above was 5.1.1 but current version
##  is 6.8.3. so that probably needs to get updated to work with modern java, but i'm not sure
##  where that's happening. the errors i was seeing were of the form of not finding libraries.
