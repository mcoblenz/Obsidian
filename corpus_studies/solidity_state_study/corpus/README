The corpus was gathered using the Google BigData query found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10601.pdf. In order to run smaller versions, the query size was cut down to 1000 and 10000 for the small and medium corpus respectively.
The small corpus was then filtered for addresses that had code in a .sol format that could be compiled with solc.
